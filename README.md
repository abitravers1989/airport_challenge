Goal of challenge: To use test-driven approach to write an object-orientated code

The Point I got to:
- Writing feature tests, unit tests and code which passes them for the plane landing and taking off. This removing them from the airport @planes array, and checking for this in the Rspec code.

How I would complete the challenge:
- Weather I would use a random number generator to then assign which method was truthy ie stormy or sunny. (I have some of the weather code there and the random number code is within the weather.rb file but deleted out).
- Capacity to be assigned the number 20 in a method. This method could also be used to produce a fail if the capacity was over 20 already. A default value for capacity could be set in initalize method so planes did not need to be created for the programme to run.
- Fail tests for stormy and capacity put in Rspec file.

How I problem solved:
- Spend potentially too much time reading the challenge and all the material first before starting.
- Started with the feature tests and then code then moved to rspec for the harder parts. Ie. making sure the planes were removed from array after take off. As was unsure of the Rspec code.
- Used Rspec documents
- Used Rspec tutorials
- Used Stackoverflow
- Used boris bike challenges which i had completed and notes from challenges.
- Used materials given by airport challenge, including testing criteria.



Evaluation of how I preformed the task:

- Spent a lot of time reading the instructions and material provided. Experiment next time with starting sooner and going back to reading material / instructions as needed.
